# SuperStore-Dataset-Dashboard-With-KPIs-
Using the Superstore dataset provided, create a dashboard consisting of at least 2 KPIs, you identified in Module 2, that will be used to answer the business question for this project. 

<h3>
KPIs must apply at least one principle around KPIs learned in this Specialization, including:
</h3>

  <p>
  Setting thresholds

  Using hierarchies

  Actions

  Filters
  </p>
  
  <h4>
  
Parameters to guide interactivity (if needed) 
  

The KPIs must also demonstrate use of at least two of the visual and cognitive principles covered in previous courses (ie., pre-attentive attributes; strategic use of color or contrast; effective use of language, labeling and scales; visual hierarchies, etc.).

For example, one could be a map (as shown below) that shows the range of discounts. Please describe which two KPI principles were used to create the dashboard, and how your KPIs demonstrate use of the specific visual and cognitive design concepts learned in this Specialization.  

Other possible KPIs to consider for this project are: 
  </h4>
  
  <p>
  Discounts per customer

  Discounts by category

  Discounts by segment

  Discounts by quantity

  Discounts by profit ratio
  </p>
