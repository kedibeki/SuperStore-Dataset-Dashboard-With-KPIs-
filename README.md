# SuperStore-Dataset-Dashboard-With-KPIs
Using the Superstore dataset,I created a dashboard consisting of at least 2 KPIs,which were used to answer the business question for this project. 

<h3>
KPIs must apply at least one principle around KPIs learned in this Specialization, including:
</h3>

  <p>
  Setting thresholds

  Using hierarchies

  Actions

  Filters
  </p>
  
  <h4>
  
Parameters to guide interactivity (if needed) 
  

This KPIs demonstrate use of visual and cognitive principles (ie., pre-attentive attributes; strategic use of color or contrast; effective use of language, labeling and scales; visual hierarchies, etc.).
 

Other possible KPIs to consider for this project are: 
  </h4>
  
  <p>
  Discounts per customer

  Discounts by category

  Discounts by segment

  Discounts by quantity

  Discounts by profit ratio
  </p>
